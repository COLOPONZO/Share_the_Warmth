A **PIC18F27J53** based, forced-air circulation controller, written in **JALv2**.

This is a project in-process.  Don't expect everything (*anything?*) here to actually work.

If you're going to follow along, you'll need some method of programming mid- and low-range PIC microcontrollers and you should also have the JALLIB package installed (to provide all of the basic library functions).  The JALLIB package already includes the JALv2 compiler.
